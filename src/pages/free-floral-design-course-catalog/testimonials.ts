    excerpt: 'I would recommend this course to those looking for a career in the floral industry.',
    quote: 'I enjoyed the courses I completed previously with QC and Floral Design ended up being no different. The instructions for each assignment were detailed, even down to how to take the pictures to show your work. Feedback from the tutor was helpful and provided the necessary encouragement in order to get the desired results going forward; plus Renee’s tips were quite helpful in navigating my own style. The videos were informative and showed you step by step how to carry out the designs. I have recently started a wedding, event planning plus decor business and hope to begin creating floral designs for clients soon.',

The Student Support staff are the rockstars behind the scenes. They are always there to answer my questions.
